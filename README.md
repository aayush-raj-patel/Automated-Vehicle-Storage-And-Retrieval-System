# Automated-Vehicle-Storage-And-Retrieval-System
The system models a parking lot as a graph where nodes are slots and edges are paths. BFS finds the nearest available slot, while DFS explores routes during errors. A queue manages vehicle entry/exit, a stack simulates LIFO multi-level parking, and linked lists track free/occupied slots dynamically with modular headers and CLI interface.
